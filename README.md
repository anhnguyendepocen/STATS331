STATS 331
=========

This is a set of lecture notes for the undergraduate course STATS 331, at
The University of Auckland. This is an undergraduate course which assumes fairly
minimal background in mathematics and probability. The first ten chapters are
relatively complete but could use more examples. The latter chapter chapters
are rough drafts that will be completed over the next year.
