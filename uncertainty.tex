\chapter{Probability and Uncertainty}
Every day, throughout our lives, we are required 
to believe certain things and not to believe other things. This applies not
only to the ``big questions'' of life, but also to trivial matters, and 
everything in between. For example, this morning I boarded the bus to 
university, sure that it would actually take me here and not to Wellington.
How did I know the bus would not take me to Wellington? Well, for starters
I have taken the same bus many times before and it has always taken me to the
university. Another clue was that the bus said ``Midtown'' on it, and a bus
to Wellington would probably have said Wellington, and would not have stopped
at a minor bus stop in suburban Auckland.

None of this evidence {\it proves} that the bus would take me to university,
but it sure makes it plausible. So plausible that the possibility of an
unplanned trip to Wellington never even entered my mind until I decided to
write this paragraph.

Somehow, our brains are very often able to accurately predict the correct answer
to many questions (e.g. the destination of a bus), even though we don't have
all of the available information that we would need to be 100\% certain.
We do this using our experience of the world and our intuition, without much
conscious attention or problem solving. However, there are areas of study where
we are unable to make such accurate judgments intuitively. Most of science involves
such situations - those questions that have already been solved are
no longer of interest.
