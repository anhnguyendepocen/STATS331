\section{Prologue}

This course was developed by Dr Wayne Stewart (formerly of The University of
Auckland) and was first offered in 2009. I joined the faculty in July 2012
and took over the course from him.

In this course we will use the following software:
\begin{itemize}
\item R ({\tt http://www.r-project.org/})
\item JAGS (\tt http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/).
\end{itemize}

In the labs, our preferred editor will be R-Studio, although any text editor
can be used in principle. These programs are all free and open source software.
That is, they are free to use, share and modify. They should work on
virtually any operating system including the three most popular:
Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and GNU/Linux.
