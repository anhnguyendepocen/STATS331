\chapter{Parameter Estimation}
One of the most important ways of using Bayes' rule is in the topic
called {\it parameter estimation}. Parameter estimation is a fairly common
situation in statistics. In fact, it is possible to interpret almost any
problem in statistics as a parameter estimation problem!

Firstly, what is a parameter? Well, it is just a fancy term for a quantity or
a number that is unknown. For example, how many people are currently in New
Zealand? Well, a Google search suggests 4.405 million. But that does not mean
there are {\bf exactly} 4,405,000 people. It could be a bit more or a bit
less. Maybe it is 4,405,323, or maybe it is 4,403,886. We don't really know.
We could call the true number of people in New Zealand right now $\theta$.
